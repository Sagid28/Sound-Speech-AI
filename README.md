# Sound and Speech AI Portfolio
Welcome to my Sound-Speech-AI portfolio! In this repository, I've showcased my practical skills in the field of AI for sound and speech applications. The contents include notebooks, each demonstrating a specific aspect of this exciting domain.

## Music Generation with LSTM
**Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network** notebook delves into the fascinating world of music generation using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Through this exercise, you'll not only grasp the intricacies of LSTM but also have the chance to create your own unique jazz compositions!

**Key Takeaways:**

Application of LSTM for music generation.

Creation of jazz music using deep learning.

Utilization of the Functional API to build complex models.

## Trigger Word Detection
**Trigger Word Detection** notebook, I've constructed a speech dataset and developed an algorithm for trigger word detection. Trigger word detection is the technology behind voice-activated devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. In this case, the trigger word is "activate," and the algorithm responds with a distinctive chime sound.

**Key Takeaways:**

Building a speech dataset.

Implementing a trigger word detection algorithm.

Enabling the algorithm to recognize and respond to the trigger word "activate."

These notebooks are aligned with skills relevant to the field of AI, such as noise reduction, speech recognition, and sound quality improvement.

Please feel free to explore the notebooks and enjoy the results of these AI endeavors.

These notebooks are a product of my journey in understanding Sound/Speech AI concepts and building practical skills, inspired by coursework from Coursera.
